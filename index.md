* Experience using C/C++ interop via ctypes, numpy, pandas matplotlib
## C# and VB.Net 
* Over tens years as primary maintainer of a large scale C#/VB.net windows forms applications
* Dependency injection pattern and test driven development
* Gained experience lately using the MVVM design pattern and windows presentation foundation (WPF) in C#
* Advanced C# programming abilities: Linq, Reflection, Multithreading
## C/C++
* Maintainer of a scientific computing application written in C++
## Databases/ORM
* Have worked with several database technologies including SQL queries, Object relation mapping (ORM), Database design in Postgres, MS Access, and SQLite
## R
Experience in debugging and writing R code integrated with C++ (using RCpp) for prototyping new version of scientific computing platform.
 
## Language Interoperability
I also have experience with low level code interoperability 
  * python with C/C++ using Ctypes
  * C# and C/C++ using using InteropServices
  * R and C++ using the RCpp package
  
## Other
 * I am currently learning Golang and Javascript with a side [project](https://github.com/smorken/freerange)
 * Experienced with dependecy injection and test driven development design patterns
 * Slowly evolving from object oriented to functional programming, but still use both
 
### Examples of work

[awsbootstrapper](https://github.com/smorken/awsbootstrapper) is a minimalist set of scripts for launching AWS compute clusters and managing upload and download of input and output.  It uses the python boto3 package to interface with AWS EC2 and S3 services.  It has been used at my workplace for multiple years of large scale monte carlo/uncertainty simulations.

[freerange](https://github.com/smorken/freerange) is a hobby/side project, primarily for learning javascript, golang and full stack development in general.
