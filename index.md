# About

I am currently a computer programmer with Natural Resources Canada, and I have been there for over 12 years. I strive to learn every day and I have built up significant experience in several programming languages and technologies.

## Python 

* I have over 10 years as a python scripter
* I have worked on projects ranging from ad hoc scripting to larger scale python applications and packages
* Experience using C/C++ interop via ctypes, numpy, pandas, matplotlib, jupyter, and many other packages

## C# and VB.Net 

* Over tens years as maintainer/developer of a large scale C#/VB.net windows forms applications: [Operational-scale CBM-CFS3](https://www.nrcan.gc.ca/forests/climate-change/carbon-accounting/13107)
* Significant experience with localization
* Dependency injection pattern and test driven development
* Gained significant experience lately using the MVVM design pattern and windows presentation foundation (WPF) in C#
* Advanced C# programming topics: Linq, Reflection, Multithreading

## C/C++

* Maintainer of a scientific computing application written in C++
* Work in newer generation scientific application with more modern C++ version (C++11)

## Databases/ORM

* Have worked with several database technologies including SQL queries, Object relation mapping (ORM), Database design in Postgres, MS Access, and SQLite

## R

* Experience in debugging and writing R code
* Prototyping new version of scientific computing platform using C++ and R integrated with the RCpp package
 
## Language Interoperability

I also have experience with low level code interoperability 
  * python with C/C++ using Ctypes
  * C# and C/C++ using using InteropServices
  * R and C++ using the RCpp package
  
## Other

 * I am currently learning Golang and Javascript with a side [project](https://github.com/smorken/freerange)
 * Experienced with dependecy injection and test driven development design patterns
 * Slowly evolving from object oriented to functional programming, but still use both
 * GIS: basic experience with Vector and Raster datasets, and their manipulation in R, C# and Python
 * Amazon web services: basic administration, and work with EC2 and S3 services.
 
 
### Examples of work

[awsbootstrapper](https://github.com/smorken/awsbootstrapper) is a minimalist set of scripts for launching AWS compute clusters and managing upload and download of input and output.  It uses the python boto3 package to interface with AWS EC2 and S3 services.  It has been used at my workplace for multiple years of large scale monte carlo/uncertainty simulations.

[freerange](https://github.com/smorken/freerange) is a hobby/side project, primarily for learning javascript, golang and full stack development in general.

[cbm3_python](https://github.com/cat-cfs/cbm3_python) is a python package for automating *Operational-Scale CBM-CFS3* simulation and other functions

[StandardImportToolPlugin](https://github.com/cat-cfs/StandardImportToolPlugin) C# application for commandline *Operational-Scale CBM-CFS3* project creation.
