# about

I am scientific support programmer working with Natural Resources Canada for over 15 years. I strive to learn every day, and I have built up significant experience in several programming languages and technologies.  I am able to learn new packages, frameworks and systems rapidly.  I am eager to contribute practical ideas to improve workflows and software.
